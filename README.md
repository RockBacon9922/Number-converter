Open source number converter web. It allows you to convert numbers from one numeral system to another, such as Decimal to Binary, Binary to Decimal, and more. 

This app is deployed with Vercel and can be accessed here: [numberconverter.vercel.app](https://numberconverter.vercel.app). I hope you have fun playing around with it.
